NAIA: I and [Erik](/en/erik) made a gummy family. Each one is different and has its own emotion ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜¢ğŸ˜¡.

ERIK: Mine are three. A baby ğŸ‘¶, one that's sick because it has cavities ğŸ¦·, and one that's sad because it has a blue face ğŸ’™.

XÃšLIO: But you haven't told me the most important thing...

NAIA: They're stickers!
