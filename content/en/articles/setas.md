This afternoon went with [ama](/ama) to eat some churros to benches at the end of Regina Street and since from there we saw the "[Setas](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.3941307,-5.9916625,3a,75y,158.91h,103.59t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sYTDVdQJkiKH1GFZTHSLTzA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DYTDVdQJkiKH1GFZTHSLTzA%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D97.82839%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192)", I decided to draw them in my little notebook.

Who are these people under them? Ama asked.

So I circled them and wrote their names: Xúlio, [Erik](/erik), Raquel e Naia!
